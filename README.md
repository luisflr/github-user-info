# GITHUB USER FINDER

I got thsi challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6) to practice and improve my skills as a frontend developer.

The challenge goes like this.

> Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the [GitHub users API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-user) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

> Your users should be able to:

> - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Search for GitHub users by their username
> - See relevant user information based on their search
> - Switch between light and dark themes
> - **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

And this is the results
